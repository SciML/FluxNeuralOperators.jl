It learns a operator, which is a mapping between infinite-dimensional function spaces. It can be used to resolve partial differential equations (PDE). Instead of solving by finite element method, a PDE problem can be resolved by training a neural network to learn an operator mapping from infinite-dimensional space (u, t) to infinite-dimensional space f(u, t). Neural operator learns a continuous function between two continuous function spaces. The kernel can be trained on different geometry, which is learned from a graph.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Fourier neural operator learns a neural operator with Dirichlet kernel to form a Fourier transformation.
